I'm Ahmed, A network engineer with over 10 years of experience in the networking industry, I am a passionate and proficient Technical Consultant at Cisco, where I collaborate with customers and partners to understand their business needs and technical requirements, and provide them with guidance and support during the implementation and onboarding process of the ThousandEyes platform, a cloud-based network intelligence solution that delivers visibility and insights into the digital experience of end-users and applications.
In my previous roles, I have worked with various vendors and technologies, including Juniper, F5, Fortinet, Huawei, AWS, and Cisco ACI, and gained expertise in network design, configuration, customisation, troubleshooting, and analysis across different environments, such as enterprise, ISP, data centres, and cloud providers. I have also leveraged my skills in routing protocols to deliver scalable, reliable, and secure network solutions for my clients. As a network consultant, I am always eager to learn new technologies, share my knowledge, and contribute to the success of my team and organisation.
