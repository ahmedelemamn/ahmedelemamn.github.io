Hi, I’m Ahmed! With over 10 years of experience in the networking industry, I am a passionate and dedicated Technical Consultant at Cisco. I specialize in collaborating with customers and partners to understand their business needs and technical requirements, guiding them through the implementation and onboarding process of the **ThousandEyes platform**—a cutting-edge cloud-based network intelligence solution that provides visibility and insights into the digital experience of end-users and applications.

Throughout my career, I’ve had the opportunity to work with a diverse range of vendors and technologies, including Juniper, F5, Fortinet, Huawei, AWS, and Cisco ACI. My expertise spans network design, configuration, customization, troubleshooting, and analysis across various environments such as enterprise networks, ISPs, data centers, and cloud providers. I have also honed my skills in **routing protocols**, delivering scalable, reliable, and secure network solutions tailored to client needs.

I’m passionate about learning new technologies, sharing knowledge, and driving the success of my team and organization. Whether it’s solving complex networking challenges or diving deep into the nuances of protocols, I’m always eager to make an impact.

Welcome to my blog, where I share insights, experiences, and lessons learned from the exciting world of networking!
