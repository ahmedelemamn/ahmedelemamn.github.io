JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format that is easy for both humans and machines to read and write. Python provides built-in support for working with JSON through the `json` module, making it a powerful tool for managing structured data.

In this blog, we will cover:
- The basics of JSON structure
- Reading and writing JSON files
- Manipulating JSON data
- Working with nested JSON objects
- Pretty-printing JSON
- Handling large JSON files efficiently
- Validating and parsing JSON data

---

## 1. Understanding JSON Structure

JSON is a text-based format that represents structured data using key-value pairs, similar to Python dictionaries. Here is an example of a JSON object:

```json
{
    "name": "Alice",
    "age": 30,
    "email": "alice@example.com",
    "hobbies": ["reading", "traveling", "cycling"],
    "address": {
        "street": "123 Main St",
        "city": "New York",
        "zip": "10001"
    }
}
```

### JSON Data Types
JSON supports the following data types:
- **String**: `"hello"`
- **Number**: `42`, `3.14`
- **Boolean**: `true`, `false`
- **Null**: `null`
- **Array**: `["apple", "banana", "cherry"]`
- **Object**: `{ "key": "value" }`

## 2. Reading JSON Files in Python

Pythonâ€™s `json` module provides functions for reading JSON files and converting them into Python dictionaries.

### Example: Reading a JSON File

```python
import json

# Load JSON from a file
with open("data.json", "r") as file:
    data = json.load(file)

print(data)
```

ðŸ’¡ **Note**: `json.load(file)` reads a JSON file and converts it into a Python dictionary.

---

## 3. Writing JSON Files in Python

To store JSON data in a file, we use `json.dump()`.

### Example: Writing to a JSON File

```python
import json

# Sample data
data = {
    "name": "Bob",
    "age": 25,
    "email": "bob@example.com",
    "skills": ["Python", "Machine Learning"]
}

# Save JSON to a file
with open("output.json", "w") as file:
    json.dump(data, file, indent=4)  # Pretty-print JSON with indentation
```

ðŸ’¡ **Key Parameters in `json.dump()`**:
- `indent=4`: Formats JSON output with indentation for readability.
- `sort_keys=True`: Sorts keys alphabetically in the output.

---

## 4. Manipulating JSON Data

Since JSON data is loaded as a Python dictionary, we can manipulate it like any other dictionary.

### Example: Modifying JSON Data

```python
# Adding a new key-value pair
data["city"] = "Los Angeles"

# Updating an existing value
data["age"] = 26

# Deleting a key
del data["email"]

# Convert back to JSON format
json_string = json.dumps(data, indent=4)
print(json_string)
```

---

## 5. Working with Nested JSON Data

JSON objects can be nested within each other. We can access nested keys using standard dictionary operations.

### Example: Accessing Nested Data

```python
json_data = {
    "user": {
        "id": 101,
        "profile": {
            "name": "Charlie",
            "preferences": {
                "theme": "dark",
                "language": "English"
            }
        }
    }
}

# Accessing nested values
theme = json_data["user"]["profile"]["preferences"]["theme"]
print("Theme:", theme)
```

### Example: Updating Nested Values

```python
json_data["user"]["profile"]["preferences"]["theme"] = "light"
```

---

## 6. Pretty-Printing JSON Data

To print JSON in a human-readable format:

```python
import json

data = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30, "email": "alice@example.com"}

# Pretty-print JSON
print(json.dumps(data, indent=4))
```

---

## 7. Handling Large JSON Files

When working with large JSON files, reading everything at once can cause memory issues. Instead, we can process the file in chunks.

### Example: Reading a Large JSON File Line by Line

```python
import json

with open("large_data.json", "r") as file:
    for line in file:
        record = json.loads(line)
        print(record)
```

For very large JSON datasets, consider using **streaming JSON parsers** like `ijson`:

```python
import ijson

with open("large_data.json", "r") as file:
    for obj in ijson.items(file, "item"):
        print(obj)
```

---

## 8. Validating JSON Data

Before processing, it is good practice to validate if the data is in valid JSON format.

### Example: Checking if a String is Valid JSON

```python
import json

json_string = '{"name": "David", "age": 40}'

try:
    data = json.loads(json_string)
    print("Valid JSON")
except json.JSONDecodeError:
    print("Invalid JSON")
```

---

## 9. Merging Two JSON Files

Sometimes, you may need to combine multiple JSON files into one.

### Example: Merging JSON Files

```python
import json

# Read first JSON file
with open("file1.json", "r") as f1:
    data1 = json.load(f1)

# Read second JSON file
with open("file2.json", "r") as f2:
    data2 = json.load(f2)

# Merge data
merged_data = {**data1, **data2}  # Merging dictionaries

# Save merged data to a new file
with open("merged.json", "w") as outfile:
    json.dump(merged_data, outfile, indent=4)
```

---

## 10. Converting JSON to CSV

Sometimes, JSON data needs to be converted into a CSV format.

### Example: JSON to CSV

```python
import json
import csv

# Read JSON data
with open("data.json", "r") as json_file:
    data = json.load(json_file)

# Write to CSV
with open("output.csv", "w", newline="") as csv_file:
    writer = csv.DictWriter(csv_file, fieldnames=data[0].keys())
    writer.writeheader()
    writer.writerows(data)
```

---

## 11. Converting CSV to JSON

Conversely, you might need to convert CSV files to JSON.

### Example: CSV to JSON

```python
import csv
import json

# Read CSV data
with open("data.csv", "r") as csv_file:
    reader = csv.DictReader(csv_file)
    rows = list(reader)

# Convert to JSON and save
with open("output.json", "w") as json_file:
    json.dump(rows, json_file, indent=4)
```
