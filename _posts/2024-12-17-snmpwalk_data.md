# Overview

This document provides an overview of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) data, specifically focusing on how to interpret SNMP walk data to understand the types and counts of network interfaces. It includes a Python script for extracting and categorizing interface types based on their Object Identifiers (OIDs).

## Understanding SNMP and OID

SNMP is a protocol used for network management, allowing administrators to manage network performance, find and solve network problems, and plan for network growth. An essential component of SNMP management data are OIDs, which uniquely identify managed objects in a MIB hierarchy. Managed objects can be any conceivable aspect of a network device, including hardware, software, or configuration attributes.

### How OID is Interpreted

An OID is a sequence of numbers that follows a hierarchical structure. The numbers are arranged in a tree structure and represent different organizations, standards, and types of data. For instance:

The OID `1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.3` represents interface types, where:

- **1** denotes ISO
- **3.6.1** denotes DOD
- **2.1** denotes internet management
- **2.2.1.3** denotes the interface type under the MIB-2 interfaces table

Each interface in an SNMP-managed device has a unique index, and its properties, like type and status, are accessed by appending the index to the base OID of the property.

---

## Some Well-Known OIDs and Their Purposes:

1. **Interface Count (ifNumber)**  
   - **OID:** `1.3.6.1.2.1.2.1.0`  
   - **Description:** Provides the number of network interfaces present on the device.

2. **Interface Description (ifDescr)**  
   - **OID:** `1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.2`  
   - **Indexed by:** `[ifIndex]`  
   - **Description:** Describes each interface, typically by name or hardware address.

3. **Operational Status (ifOperStatus)**  
   - **OID:** `1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.8`  
   - **Indexed by:** `[ifIndex]`  
   - **Description:** Represents the current operational status of an interface (e.g., up, down).

4. **Administrative Status (ifAdminStatus)**  
   - **OID:** `1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.7`  
   - **Indexed by:** `[ifIndex]`  
   - **Description:** Represents the desired state of the interface (e.g., enabled, disabled).

5. **Interface Type (ifType)**  
   - **OID:** `1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.3`  
   - **Indexed by:** `[ifIndex]`  
   - **Description:** Indicates the type of interface (e.g., Ethernet, token ring).

6. **Interface Maximum Transmission Unit (ifMtu)**  
   - **OID:** `1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.4`  
   - **Indexed by:** `[ifIndex]`  
   - **Description:** Represents the maximum packet size for the interface.

7. **Interface Table (ifTable):**  
   - **OID:** `1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2`  
   - **Indexed by:** `[ifIndex]`  
   - **Description:** A list of interface entries, with the number of entries given by the value of `ifNumber`.

## Script for SNMP Data Analysis

The following script processes an SNMP walk file to count and categorize network interfaces. It reads interface types from the OID `1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.3.x`, maps them to human-readable names, and outputs the total count for each type.

```python
def parse_snmp_data_from_file(file_path):
    interface_details = {}
    interface_indices = {}
    if_type_names = {
        6: "Ethernet",
        53: "Proprietary Virtual/Internal",
        24: "Software Loopback"
    }

    try:
        with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
            for line in file:
                parts = line.strip().split('|')
                if not parts or len(parts) < 3:
                    continue

                oid = parts[0]
                value = parts[2]

                if oid.startswith('1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.3.'):
                    index = int(oid.split('.')[-1])
                    try:
                        if_type_value = int(value)
                        type_name = if_type_names.get(if_type_value, f"Unknown Type ({if_type_value})")
                        interface_details[index] = type_name
                        if type_name in interface_indices:
                            interface_indices[type_name].append(index)
                        else:
                            interface_indices[type_name] = [index]
                    except ValueError:
                        print(f"Skipping non-integer data for OID {oid}: {value}")

    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"Error: The file {file_path} does not exist.")
        return 0, {}, {}
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
        return 0, {}, {}

    type_count = {type_name: len(indices) for type_name, indices in interface_indices.items()}
    return len(interface_details), type_count, interface_indices


file_path = input("Please enter the path to the SNMP data file: ")

total_interfaces, interface_types, interface_indices = parse_snmp_data_from_file(file_path)
if total_interfaces > 0:
    print(f"Total Interfaces Reported by File: {total_interfaces}")
    for if_type, count in interface_types.items():
        print(f"{if_type} count: {count} (Indices: {interface_indices[if_type]})")
else:
    print("No interfaces were processed.")
```

## Script Features

- **Interface Categorization:** Maps each interface index to a type and counts them.  
- **Output:** Lists total interfaces and the count for each type with indices.

---

## How to Run the Script

1. **Prepare the environment:** Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.

2. **Script Execution:**  
   - Save the script in a file, e.g., `snmp_analysis.py`.  
   - Run the script from the command line:

   ```bash
   python snmp_analysis.py
   ```

   - When prompted, enter the full path to your SNMP walk file.

## Example Output

```text
Please enter the path to the SNMP data file: /path/to/your/data.txt
Total Interfaces Reported by File: 37
Ethernet count: 28 (Indices: [1, 2, ...])
